# Sancus - Contextual Video

## Description
The system is modular and its application depends on the data source and context. Example data sources could include the Google Knowledge Graph, verified news media, government data, private product data, or publicly accessible information. Facial recognition and AR are optional components that can be triggered only if needed due to sensitivity and scalability.

As a person is speaking or as voiceover is playing in a video, Sancus can be used to display data as past statements, prior events, factual corrections, related info and other germane information. Some initial thought starters:



News: Politicians making campaign speeches could be checked against prior promises or factual claims.
News: CEOs discussing a company's quarterly peformance could display prior earnings data.
Entertainment: A film director interview could reference prior work or other artistic inspiration.
Entertainment: Celebrity or YouTube creator vlogging could trigger retail links, product links
Product: Voiceover for product reviews can trigger spec displays and associated products
Product: Voiceover in travel destinations could display flight pricing, local history, tour maps
Education: A professor lecture could show links to relevant abstracts and concepts


The system could be deployed as a feature (button) on YouTube, Google Lens, Google Cameos or developed as Google Cloud service offering, or applied in other initiatives. Below are quick examples of how Sancus might be applied in different contexts (entertainment, news, education) through different Google Products (YouTube player, YouTube on TV, Lens)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
